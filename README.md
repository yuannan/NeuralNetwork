An Artifical Neural Network for the purpose of differentiating between 2 or more languages.

Built on Netbeans 8.2 using Swing on Netbeans.
Should be multiplatform but development is all done on Arch Linux under GNOME.

All code is written by hand with minimal external libs, if any.
Useage of the built in Java libs includes but not limited to ArrayList, FileWriter and FileReader.

I've included 3 word lists sourced from various places on the internet. If you want me to remove or credit you just gimme a shout.
The lists are in standard ASCII.
Your own word lists can be used if it is in the same format.

A precompile version can be found in /dist.

If you want to export weights a folder called "weights" must be made in order to dump the weights there.
Without the folder you can just copy and paste the output from the main interface into a text file.

No licence is included.
